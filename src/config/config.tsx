export const about__text = `


  My profession is law, but always in my life, I have felt that it was not what I wanted. I have always loved computers <br>
  and was interested in programming. Today I can boldly say that I found a profession I love and enjoy doing. </br>
  My hobby is creating reusable components.
  <br>
  <br> 
  As a lawyer with a passion for programming, I have pursued my interest in front-end development and have become skilled <br>
  in a variety of techniques, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Three.js, React.js, Next.js, Liquid, Shopify, Framer Motion, and Node.js. <br>
  Currently working as a front-end developer intern, I have been able to apply my legal training to identify and solve complex problems in programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  My experience in both law and programming has taught me the value of attention to detail and precision in all aspects of my work.<br>
  I thrive in environments where I can be creative and find innovative solutions to challenges. I am also committed to staying <br>
  up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in front-end development and am always eager to learn new skills <br>
  and take on new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  I am excited to explore opportunities that allow me to combine my legal background and programming skills to create <br>
  meaningful and impactful work. Whether it's developing user-friendly interfaces or building responsive and dynamic web <br>
  applications, I am eager to use my unique skill set to contribute to innovative and forward-thinking projects.
